 * SOFT KILLS
 */

DR_EXPORT
/**
 * Registers for the "soft kills" event, which helps to execute process
 * exit events when a process is terminated by another process.
 *
 * The callback's return value indicates whether to skip the
 * termination action by the application: i.e., true indicates to skip
 * it (the usual case) and false indicates to continue with the
 * application action.  In some cases, individually continuing
 * requires emulation when the original application action involved
 * multiple processes.
 *
 * When there are multiple registered callbacks, if any callback
 * returns true, the application action is skipped.
 *
 * In normal usage, upon receiving this callback the client will send
 * a nudge (see dr_nudge_client_ex()) to the targeted process.  The
 * nudge handler then performs any shutdown actions, such as
 * instrumentation result output.  The handler then terminates the
 * target process from within, allowing the callback in the targeting
 * process to skip the termination action.  Passing the exit code to
 * the nudge handler is recommended to preserve the intended
 * application exit code.
 *
 * The nudge handler should support being invoked multiple times
 * (typically by having only the first one take effect) as in some
 * cases a parent process will terminate child processes in multiple
 * ways.
 *
 * This event must be registered for during process initialization, in
 * order to properly track per-thread information.  Un-registering is
 * not supported: soft kills cannot be in effect for only part of the
 * process lifetime.
 *
 * Soft kills can be risky.  If the targeted process is not under
 * DynamoRIO control, the nudge might terminate it, but in a different
 * manner than would have occurred.  If the nudge fails for some
 * reason but the targeter's termination is still skipped, the child
 * process might be left alive, causing the application to behave
 * incorrectly.
 *
 * The implementation of this event uses drmgr's CLS
 * (drmgr_register_cls_field()), which conflicts with
 * dr_get_tls_field().  A client using this event must use
 * drmgr_register_tls_field() instead of dr_get_tls_field().
 *
 * \return whether successful.
